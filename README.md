What is it?  It lets you set your goals for reminder what you need to accomplish. There is text tells you how many todos left. when you create new todo they are added to text each time you create new todo text shows you you have got x = number todos left.  when you complete your set goal and click checkbox number in text is decremented and you can remove them by clicking remove button. you can also filter by title.

All you have to do is install node-modules and run dev-server on dependencies

# What technology is used?
__JavaScript__, __HTML5__, __CSS3__, __WEBPACK__, __BABEL__, 


And as storage I used localStorage for storing and removing

As not all browsers support new cutting-edge javascript I used __BABEL__ for converting ES5+ syntax to all browser compatible ones. I incorperated __WEBPACK__ to run babel and use modular systems for writing cleaner code.

## Suggestions  are very welcome
I pleasedly take any bugs and suggestions.
